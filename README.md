 Master Expense Tracker
 <br/>
Master Expense Tracker is a fully functional full-stack web application designed to help users manage and track their personal expenses efficiently.
It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and supports features like secure authentication, real-time expense tracking, and a clean, modern user interface.
This project is perfect for individuals who want a simple and private way to monitor how they spend money daily. 
Users can register, log in, and maintain a private dashboard where they can add, view, and delete expenses.
All user data is stored securely in the backend using MongoDB and is completely personalized — one user cannot see another’s expenses.
